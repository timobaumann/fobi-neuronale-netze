    "Jupyter Notebooks are a technology that allow to mix programming code, results of the program snippets and rich-text descriptions of what's going on (in the form of Markdown markup). For example, up here you read what's going on and there will be code and results further down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are organized as a sequence of **cells**. The cell that is currently active is marked by a bright line at the left. In the beginning, this first cell is probably the one that is marked as active. You can make a cell active by clicking on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cells can have different types, specifically they can be code, markdown or raw text. Towards the top of the window, there is a setting for changing the cell type (this one is set to \"Markdown\").\n",
    "\n",
    "To edit a markdown cell, double-click on it. Notice? Now you don't see the formatted text anymore but the markdown that describes the formatting. To get back to the properly formatted version, click on the little \"play\" button on the top (a little to the left of where it says \"Markdown\"); alternatively, you may press Shift+Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html) for the many formatting instructions, e.g. for *cursive*, **bold**, ***bold cursive***, ~strike-through~ and so on. Make a heading or subheading by putting a hash sign at the beginning of a line. \n",

    "## like so for a heading on the second level (similar to &lt;h2&gt; in HTML).\n",
